7.2 MSa/s Digital Oscilloscope Using the STM32F429

I used the discovery board.

Needs some cleanup, and also some features like Volts/Div and Time/Div are not fully implemented yet. Sample rate is fixed to 7.2 Msps. Might do the cleanup and the complete the project if it received enough attention and donation.
