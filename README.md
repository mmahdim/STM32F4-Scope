# stm32f4scope
7.2 MSa/s Digital Oscilloscope Using the STM32F429

I used the discovery board. CubeIDE & TouchGFX are used to build this project.

Needs some cleanup, and also some features like Volts/Div and Time/Div are not fully implemented yet. Sample rate is fixed to 7.2 Msps. Might do the cleanup and the complete the project if it received enough attention and donation.

I also have written a Python application which receives the waveform from the USB VCP and displays the waveform on PC, which I will upload if the project received public attention.

Here's a youtube Demo:
